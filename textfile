3)
a)
Processes may be in one of these states
D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R    running or runnable (on run queue)
S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T    stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced
W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
X    dead (should never be seen)
Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

b)
child1 is in running(R+) state
child2 is in interruptible sleep(S+) state
child3 is in zombie state

c)To get our process in traced or stopped state we can press (ctrl+Z) in terminal


5) I achieved a significant difference in the load average by creating parallel child processes using fork() in the for loop which will utilize 
significant percentage of cpu


6) 
a) signal number -12
b)corresponding interrupt- SIGSYS    
Description-Bad argument to routine

c) /proc/interrupts
I waited for some time and compared the results
